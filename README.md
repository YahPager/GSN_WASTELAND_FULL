GSN_WASTELAND_FULL
==================

This is the GSNGaming.com Version of the Team Wasteland Mod. Their Code Our Tweaking.

Basically this is the Team Wasteland Code from their Github Page https://github.com/A3Wasteland/ArmA3_Wasteland.Stratis/tree/Development_Main
I have made a custom Mission.sqm for the GSNGaming.com Version and Added or Delete of their code to our liking.

This server was once 13th in the world (7th in the world in Wasteland Mods) and I hope by having this on Github I can
get this server back where it was.
